export class Ingredient {
 /*   public name_: string;
    public amount : number; 
    constructor(name:string, amount:number){
        this.name_= name;
        this.amount =amount;
    }

    //another way to use constructor for auto add properties: 
    constructor(public name: string, public amount: number){}
}
 

 View encapsulation: 
    Angular enforces to change the style attribute for each Component and encapsules.

Using <ng-content></ng-content> we can show all contents of components 
    and modification in the like this <app-selector [something] = "sanotherthing" 
    <p>some paragraph too</p>  </app-selector> 
ngOnChanges: called after a bound property changes
ngOnInit : Called once the component is initialized
ngDoCheck:  .. every changes detection
ngAfterContentInit: .. after content(ng-content) has been projected into View.
ngAfterContentChecked: .. everytime the projected content has been checked 
ngAfterViewInit: .. after the component's view (and child's view has been initialized)
ngAfterViewChecked: .. everytime the view has been checked 
ngOnDestroy:
